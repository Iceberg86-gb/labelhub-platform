# Human Pending

## M6 工程加固(P0/P1)

- [M6-P0 resolved] Baseline lock and full smoke audit completed on `m6-engineering-hardening`; `m5-p7-baseline` tag exists, and `docs/internal/m6p0-smoke-audit-report.md` records 53 audit checks.
- [M6-P0.5 resolved] Submission lifecycle semantics decision is complete: Q1-Q9=A, Q10=B; `submitted` is the immutable answer fact, `under_ai_review` will be V9-normalized, AI/reviewer facts stay append-only, and `deadlineAt` is required at task create.
- [M6-P1 resolved] Submission Lifecycle + Default Flow Repair implemented: V9 normalizes `under_ai_review` to `submitted`, normal submit writes `submitted`, real-submit reviewer/export regressions were added, AI review is guarded as a side fact, and create-task `deadlineAt` is contract-required with controlled validation.
- [M6-P2 ready] Owner Setup UX Repair: schema creation discoverability, owner task created-time display, status-label polish, and repeat-claim copy/UX clarification.
- [M6-P3 pending] Cost/performance baseline is gated by M6-P2/final smoke because export and reviewer measurements should be taken after lifecycle and setup UX repairs are verified.

## M3 启动前必做(P0)

- [M3 启动前] Ensure M2-P4 frontend schema types derive from generated OpenAPI types instead of hand-written interfaces.
- [M3 启动前] Run `mvn -pl services/api test` on a machine with Docker available so `SchemaApiIntegrationTest` and other `@Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)` integration tests execute instead of being skipped.
- [M3 启动前] Run `mvn -pl services/api test` on a machine with Docker available so `M1ApiIntegrationTest` executes instead of being skipped by `@Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)`.
- [M3 启动前] Prepare the next acceptance script and defense recording plan; actual recording remains deferred until the broader M3-M5 feature set is ready.
- [M3 启动前] Add a stable cleanup guard for stale duplicate `* 2.class` artifacts under `services/api/target/classes`; the active workspace has moved out of iCloud/File Provider Desktop, but long smoke sessions should still fail fast if polluted build output appears.

## M3 期间(P1)

### AI / Provenance

- [M3 计划] Define the minimal AI supervision flow around `ai_calls`, `ai_calls_in_field`, idempotency keys, prompt versioning, and field-level provenance.
- [M3 计划] Decide whether M3 uses one provider directly or introduces a provider abstraction from the start.
- [M3 计划] Decide synchronous vs asynchronous AI calls for first integration; synchronous is simpler, async needs polling and job state.
- [M3 计划] Define AI failure, timeout, and cost-limit behavior before exposing UI triggers.
- [M5 计划] Implement provider retry/backoff behavior using `AiProviderException.retryable`, `providerCode`, and `statusCode`; M3 only records diagnostics and maps public provider failure.
- [M4 计划] Revisit idempotency key semantics if returned/resubmitted submissions mutate in place; M3-P1 reserves the input-hash mismatch guard to avoid stale AI evidence reuse.
- [M3-P6 计划] Implement the OpenAI-compatible provider path after the mock-backed service/controller/UI path is stable. 结果:M3-P6 已完成代码层 provider abstraction,M5-P6 已用 DeepSeek 完成真实 smoke。
- [M3-P5 计划] Decide the safe read shape for field-finding text in Submission detail UI; M3-P3 keeps raw `responsePayload` server-only, so frontend should not depend on raw provider payload leakage.
- [M3-P5 计划] Decide whether `GET /submissions/{id}/ai-review` should expose historical `overallSuggestion`, `summary`, and field-finding text as a safe read DTO; M3-P4 shows only public `AiCall` metadata in the provenance Card.
- [M4 计划] Reuse or extend the shared `AiProvenanceCard` for Reviewer review pages once Reviewer visibility and accept/reject flows are designed.
- [M4 计划] Decide whether Labeler should see cost/latency in production mode or whether those fields become Owner/Reviewer-only while hashes and timestamps remain visible to all permitted readers.
- [M3-P3 后续验证] Run `AiReviewIntegrationTest` on a Docker-enabled machine or local MySQL/API smoke environment so the new AI review HTTP/DB path executes instead of being skipped.
- [M5 计划] Persist failed AI provider attempts as append-only `ai_calls.status=failed` facts once retry/backoff and failure evidence semantics are designed.
- [M5 计划] Replace synchronous AI review with async job state only when outbox/worker/polling behavior is implemented; M3 keeps calls synchronous and terminal.
- [M3-P6 resolved by M5-P6] 真实 OpenAI-compatible provider smoke 已用 DeepSeek (`deepseek-v4-flash`) 补齐；截图为 `phase-m5p6-deepseek-first-call.png` 和 `phase-m5p6-deepseek-idempotency-hit.png`,DB 证据为 `phase-m5p6-db-ai-ledger-evidence.png`。
- [M5 计划] Use provider `usage` token counts and model-specific pricing to compute `ai_calls.cost_decimal` instead of M3's fixed estimated per-call cost.
- [M5 计划] Add streaming response support only after the synchronous provenance path and async job semantics are stable.
- [M5 计划] Add encrypted API key storage / management UI instead of requiring raw provider keys in local env.
- [M5 计划] Add provider-specific adapters only when OpenAI-compatible behavior is insufficient, e.g. native Anthropic messages or provider tool-use APIs.

### Frontend / Auth / Shell

- [M3 计划] Implement login-after-redirect: `RequireAuth` should preserve the intended protected URL and `LoginPage` should return there after successful login.
- [M3 计划] Revisit `AppLayout` ownership if FSD boundaries become stricter: move the layout to `app/` or inject logout behavior instead of importing a feature hook from `shared/ui`.
- [M3 计划] Replace the frontend-local Task transition matrix with an API/OpenAPI capability if task workflow rules become configurable.
- [M3 计划] Replace temporary `actorId` Timeline display (`我` / `用户 #id`) with user display names once a user lookup endpoint exists.
- [M3 计划] Let `ForbiddenPage` distinguish "role cannot access this page" from "account has no available product modules" if no-role users become possible.
- [M3 计划] Add a frontend test harness for hooks/components (Vitest plus React Testing Library or equivalent) so `useAutosave` fake-timer tests and dataset upload UI tests can run inside the web workspace.

### Labeler / Submission / Dataset

- [M3 计划] Consider moving `SubmissionEntity` and `SubmissionMapper` from `module/schema` to `module/submission` once M2 submit/render flows settle, so the package boundary matches the submission domain.
- [M3 计划] Add draft revision history and rollback UI for Labeler sessions; P6 uses only the latest draft revision.
- [M3 计划] Improve submit-failure recovery in the Labeler session page by re-enabling autosave or exposing an explicit retry/edit state after a failed submit attempt.
- [M3 计划] Evaluate batch claim / claim-and-continue workflows for Labelers who want to reserve multiple dataset items from the same task.
- [M3 计划] Add a dataset-items list/preview endpoint and Owner UI so uploaded datasets can be inspected without direct SQL.
- [M3 计划] Add dataset edit/delete/archive policy and an optional standalone dataset management page if Owners need cross-task dataset operations.
- [M3 计划] Add an integration or controller smoke check that exercises generated OpenAPI multipart method validation annotations against the concrete controller implementation.
- [M3 计划] Add explicit request-parameter conversion tests for lowercase OpenAPI enum wire values such as `DatasetImportFormat` so multipart form fields cannot regress to Java enum-name conversion.
- [M3 计划] Add schema compatibility checks for dataset item payloads against the task's current schema before allowing publish or import confirmation.
- [M3 计划] Enrich `GET /my/sessions` with task title and `submissionId` so submitted rows in "我的数据" can link directly to `/labeler/submissions/{submissionId}` instead of the read-only session page.
- [M3 计划] Add a Submission detail comparison between the current task schema and the historical submission schema, e.g. "task 当前已是 v2", once the frontend has a supported current-schema contract.
- [M4 启动前] Run a cross-identity sweep over M2/M3 GET endpoints to catch ownership gaps similar to the M2-P5c `render-schema` gap fixed in M3-P3.5.
- [M4 计划] Design an Owner-specific submission review detail endpoint instead of reusing the Labeler-only `GET /submissions/{id}` contract when M4 opens review workflow.
- [M4 计划] Add AI field-finding history navigation and optional click-to-field linking once the safe historical findings DTO is defined.

### Schema Designer

- [M3 计划] Decide schema version deprecation semantics before exposing any lifecycle mutation: separate event table vs metadata status, and impact on Labeler visibility.
- [M3 计划] Add a first-class schema creation UI from `/owner/schemas`; P4a lists existing schemas and enters Designer only.
- [M3 计划] Evaluate select option value uniqueness in Designer; P4b auto-generates option values but does not enforce uniqueness before publish.
- [M3 计划] Optimize marketplace available-item counts with a batched query if P5/P6 pages grow beyond small demo-sized result sets; P5a intentionally uses simple per-task counts.

## M4 期间(P2)

- [M4 计划] Implement Reviewer review queue, review actions, and submission review transitions.
- [M4 计划] Implement Quality Ledger writes from review actions and derive `current_verdicts` from ledger facts.
- [M4 计划] Define submission return / resubmit behavior if Reviewer rejects or requests correction.
- [M4 计划] Decide Reviewer visibility into Labeler drafts, final submissions, AI traces, and schema-history facts.

### M4 Phase 4 Resolved

- 已解决: Reviewer queue now replaces the placeholder route and supports URL-synced verdict filtering.
- 已解决: Reviewer submission detail composes historical schema rendering, shared AI provenance, ledger history, and approve/reject actions without extracting a rigid page shell.
- 已解决: Approve/reject appends Quality Ledger entries and refetches derived verdict, ledger history, and reviewer queue state from server truth.
- 已解决: Live smoke repaired generated-controller validation annotation parity and Reviewer AI provenance read access.

### M4 Phase 5 Resolved

- 已解决: M4 acceptance checklist is published at `docs/m4-acceptance-checklist.md`.
- 已解决: README now marks highlight 2 as "M4 完整,M5 持续完善" and documents M4 Reviewer/Quality Ledger capabilities.
- 已解决: Screenshot INDEX references the six M4-P4 Reviewer evidence screenshots and marks approve/reject as the亮点 2 UI evidence.
- 已解决: Decision log contains the M4 quarter closing summary, including decisions, live-smoke fixes, workflow milestones, and the亮点 2 evidence chain.

## M5 期间(P3)

- [M5-P1 后续] Implement async export jobs only after synchronous task export proves the canonical artifact path; M5-P1 keeps the old V1 job table as metadata while the API contract is synchronous.
- [M5-P2 后续] Add fact-level export diff attribution after the hash-level diff endpoint is stable; M5-P1/P3 diff stays at file/hash equality for reproducibility evidence.
- [M5-P2 后续] Add a real AWS S3 or other S3-compatible storage switch smoke once credentials and bucket policy are available; M5-P1 uses the AWS S3 SDK against MinIO-compatible configuration.
- [M5-P2 后续] Decide export retention and object-key cleanup policy before adding delete/archive behavior; append-only snapshot rows currently assume immutable artifacts.
- [M5-P3 后续] Add object-storage residue cleanup for failed exports; M5-P2 rolls back SQL rows transactionally, but MinIO/S3 PUTs cannot be rolled back with the database transaction.
- [M5-P3 resolved by M5-P6] Trusted Export path was exercised against local MinIO through the browser smoke; `phase-m5p3b-diff-modal-equal.png` verifies the uploaded artifact hashes and file list at the UI level.
- [M5-P3 后续] Consider a read model or additional indexes for `export_snapshots.manifest_hash` / `source_state_hash` only after real export volume is known.
- [M5-P3b 后续] Design a download endpoint or signed URL strategy for exported artifacts; P3a exposes snapshot metadata and object keys but does not stream/download MinIO objects.
- [M5-P3b 后续] Add fact-level diff attribution UI after the hash-level modal evidence is stable; P3b intentionally shows three hash rows plus file-level SHA-256 matches only.
- [M5-P3b 后续] Add batch export and export-management views only after single-task Trusted Export has enough real usage; P3b keeps exports inside the task detail page.
- [M5-P3b resolved by M5-P6] Trusted Export browser screenshot smoke was rerun locally and archived: empty state, one snapshot, two selected snapshots, and equal diff modal.
- [M5-P3a resolved] `ExportIntegrationTest` is implemented and Docker-disabled in constrained environments; M5-P6 browser smoke supplied the live MinIO evidence needed for M5 acceptance.
- [M5-P5 resolved] Reviewer ledger history UI exposes `ai_field_finding` entries with payload narrowing by `entryType`; Owner/Labeler ledger cards remain a later product surface.
- [M5-P5 resolved] HTTP/DB integration tests now cover new AI review -> `ai_field_finding` rows and idempotency hit -> no duplicate ledger entries.
- [M5+ 计划] Add reviewer accept/reject decisions for individual AI findings as separate `reviewer_field_decision` ledger entries instead of mutating AI facts.
- [M5+ 计划] Add click-to-field navigation from AI finding ledger rows once the field-level ledger UI is stable.
- [M5-P5 resolved] Reviewer ledger UI now displays `ai_field_finding` rows with AI/severity tags, `AI Call #id`, field path, finding text, and confidence; integration tests now cover AI review ledger writes, idempotency non-duplication, three-role reads, and cross-labeler 404.
- [M5-P5 resolved by M5-P6] Reviewer mixed AI/reviewer ledger UI screenshots were captured locally: `phase-m5p5-reviewer-ledger-mixed.png` and `phase-m5p5-reviewer-ledger-mixed-after-approve.png`.
- [M5-P6 resolved] Real DeepSeek smoke completed with provider metadata, idempotency hit, sanitized DB evidence, Trusted Export screenshots, and mixed AI/reviewer ledger screenshots.
- [M5-P7 resolved] M5 acceptance checklist, README highlight status, screenshot INDEX evidence chains, M5 quarter summary, and humanpending cleanup are complete.
- [M5+ 计划] Replace fixed `AI_COST_PER_CALL` estimates with provider usage/token-based pricing once the OpenAI-compatible response usage payload is normalized.
- [M5+ 计划] Add retry/backoff and provider-specific JSON hardening for real provider responses after the first DeepSeek smoke proved the happy path.
- [M5+ 计划] Re-run Trusted Export final-defense smoke with at least one still-`submitted` submission in scope so the snapshot list demonstrates nonzero submitted-record counts as well as hash reproducibility.
- [M5+ 计划] Replace the AI Drawer success copy that still says "Mock provider" when the active provider is OpenAI-compatible/DeepSeek.
- [M5+ 计划] Add Owner/Labeler ledger history cards after the Reviewer evidence surface proves the mixed reviewer/AI entry shape in real usage.
- [M5+ 计划] Add AI finding aggregation and ledger entry-type filters only after the minimal mixed-entry UI is stable.
- [M5 计划] Materialize `current_verdicts` cache for hot reviewer queue queries; M4 derives Verdict from ledger on every read, sufficient for demo scale.
- [M5 resolved] AI findings (`ai_field_finding`) are now field-level ledger entries and `QualityLedgerEntryPayload` is oneOf; future `reviewer_field_decision` remains a product enhancement.
- [M5 计划] Reviewer assignment mechanism (`reviewer_assignments` table + UI), replacing M4's "any REVIEWER role sees all" model.
- [M5 计划] Self-review policy refinements for multi-role users beyond M4's hard 409 block, including admin override or assignment-level exceptions if governance requires them.
- [M5 计划] Reviewer queue SQL/read-model optimization with dedicated indexes after real reviewer usage volume is known.
- [M5 resolved] Automated validation annotation parity checks now cover export controller query constraints; continue adding focused reflection tests for new generated controllers.
- [M5 计划] Add a confirmation modal for Reviewer approve/reject once review actions become higher-volume or non-demo irreversible actions.
- [M5 计划] Add auto-advance to the next pending submission after approve/reject for reviewer throughput workflows.
- [M5 计划] Add status filtering UI to the Reviewer queue if non-submitted review states become visible.
- [M5 计划] Reintroduce Excel dataset import only when M5 has an actual parser/import implementation and large-file handling decision.
- [M5 计划] Replace synchronous 10MB dataset import with async import jobs, progress polling, and larger-file handling.
- [M5 计划] Revisit dataset import mutability; M2 stores `import_status` on `datasets`, but an append-only import-event table may better preserve import lifecycle evidence once async jobs exist.
- [M5-P7 resolved] Trusted Export business logic over `export_snapshots`, file hashes, canonicalization version, and hash-level diff evidence is complete.
- [M5-P7 resolved] AI provenance and training-pollution control now include provider metadata, model/prompt version tracking, idempotency reuse, real provider smoke, and AI findings exposed through ledger/review evidence.

## M6 加分项(P4)

- [M6 加分] Add cross-level Designer drag-and-drop between top-level fields and `nested_object` children; P4 only supports same-level ordering.
- [M6 加分] Add Designer draft persistence through localStorage or a backend draft endpoint; P4 keeps drafts in the current page session only.
- [M6 加分] Add "load historical version into Designer" for fork/rollback workflows after version semantics are designed.
- [M6 加分] Add bidirectional Designer JSON editing once validation and conflict UX are designed.
- [M6 加分] Define a real file-upload endpoint (`POST /uploads` or session-scoped multipart upload), integrate MinIO storage, and replace the P6 `FileUploadFieldRenderer` text placeholder with actual upload and preview behavior.

## 已解决(归档)

### M4 Phase 3 Resolved

- 已解决: Quality Ledger and real-time Verdict HTTP endpoints are implemented through generated `ReviewsApi` in `ReviewerController`.
- 已解决: `SecurityConfig` now gates Reviewer queue and ledger writes with `REVIEWER`, while ledger/verdict reads remain authenticated and service-guarded.
- 已解决: Controllers extract raw role codes from `JwtPrincipal.roles()` and pass them to `LedgerService`, `VerdictService`, and `SchemaService.renderForSubmission`.
- 已解决: `SubmissionsController.getSubmissionRenderSchema` now uses the role-aware render-schema overload, enabling Reviewer review pages without changing existing Owner/Labeler service callers.
- 已解决: `QualityDtoMapper` converts physical ledger fields to public DTO fields and keeps the ledger payload strongly typed as `ReviewerOverallVerdictPayload`.
- 已解决: Disabled-without-Docker integration tests cover reviewer queue filters, ledger append, self-review 409, HTTP-level verdict re-derivation, reviewer render-schema access, and ledger read defenses.

### M4 Phase 2 Resolved

- 已解决: `LedgerService` writes append-only `reviewer_overall_verdict` entries with entry-type whitelist validation, payload shape validation, task-id alignment, and self-review blocking.
- 已解决: `VerdictService` derives live `pending` / `approved` / `rejected` verdicts from the latest ledger entry without maintaining `current_verdicts`.
- 已解决: `ReviewerQueueService` delegates to the SQL-level reviewer queue projection while preserving default submitted-status filtering and paged totals.
- 已解决: Services accept explicit requester role sets so M4-P3 can keep HTTP/security role extraction outside business services.
- 已解决: `SchemaService.renderForSubmission` has a reviewer-aware overload, allowing M4 reviewer pages to reuse historical schema rendering without reopening the M2-P5c ownership gap.
- 已解决: Unit tests cover `new_ledger_entry_changes_verdict`, self-review rejection, payload validation, reviewer access, and the latest-verdict SQL tie-break contract.

### M4 Phase 1 Resolved

- 已解决: OpenAPI is now `0.7.0` with Quality Ledger, real-time Verdict, Reviewer queue, and submission-nested ledger/verdict contracts.
- 已解决: V1 `quality_ledger_entries.evidence_type` is reused as the physical ledger type column; public API exposes it as `entryType` without adding V8 migration.
- 已解决: `QualityLedgerEntryMapper` is append-only and reflection-guarded with insert/select-only methods.
- 已解决: Verdict latest-entry selection uses `ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC` for deterministic tie-breaking.
- 已解决: M4 reserves 409 `SELF_REVIEW_NOT_ALLOWED` and 400 `LEDGER_ENTRY_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` public errors for the Service phase.

### M3 Phase 1 Resolved

- 已解决: OpenAPI is now `0.6.0` with M3 AI review trigger and provenance contracts.
- 已解决: AI review output uses typed `FieldFinding` and `overallSuggestion`, not M4 `Verdict`.
- 已解决: `ai_calls` and `ai_calls_in_field` have append-only hand-written mapper contracts with no `BaseMapper` parent.
- 已解决: Public AI provider failures map to 502 `AI_PROVIDER_FAILURE`, and the idempotency input-hash guard has a reserved 409 `AI_PROVIDER_INPUT_HASH_MISMATCH` code.

### M3 Phase 2 Resolved

- 已解决: `AiProvider` interface and deterministic `MockAiProvider` are implemented for M3 service tests.
- 已解决: `AiReviewService.review` writes canonical-hashed `ai_calls` and field-level `ai_calls_in_field` rows with Owner ownership validation.
- 已解决: Idempotency hit reuses persisted AI evidence without invoking the provider again.
- 已解决: Same idempotency key with changed input hash throws `AiInputHashMismatchException` instead of silently reusing stale evidence.

### M3 Phase 3 Resolved

- 已解决: Owner can trigger AI review through `POST /submissions/{submissionId}/ai-review` and receive `AiReviewResult` with `idempotencyHit`.
- 已解决: Owner and the submitting Labeler can read AI provenance through `GET /submissions/{submissionId}/ai-review`; cross-identity reads return 404.
- 已解决: Route security distinguishes trigger vs read: POST requires Owner, GET requires authentication plus Service-level ownership.
- 已解决: `AiReviewDtoMapper` exposes public provenance metadata and derived hashes without exposing raw request/response payloads.
- 已解决: Disabled-without-Docker integration tests cover AI review trigger, provenance read, idempotency reuse, and cross-role/cross-identity defenses.

### M3 Phase 3.5 Resolved

- 已解决: Owner can discover task submissions through `GET /tasks/{taskId}/submissions` without exposing answer payloads or content hashes.
- 已解决: M2-P5c `GET /submissions/{submissionId}/render-schema` ownership gap is patched; only the submission Labeler or task Owner can read the historical render payload.
- 已解决: `SubmissionMapper` remains append-only and reflection-guarded after adding paged select queries for Owner submission discovery.
- 已解决: Disabled-without-Docker integration tests cover Owner submission discovery and render-schema cross-identity defenses.

### M3 Phase 4 Resolved

- 已解决: Owner task detail now lists task submissions and links to the nested `/owner/tasks/{taskId}/submissions/{submissionId}` route.
- 已解决: Owner submission detail renders historical schema answers through the guarded render-schema endpoint without using the Labeler-only submission detail endpoint.
- 已解决: Owner can trigger mock-backed AI review from the UI and see first-call vs idempotency-hit states in the AI result Drawer.
- 已解决: P4 live smoke fixed the AI `outputHash` normalization gap so first trigger, idempotency hit, and provenance GET share the same derived hash.

### M3 Phase 5 Resolved

- 已解决: `AiProvenanceCard` is now a shared read-only component for Owner and Labeler submission detail pages.
- 已解决: Labeler submission detail shows AI provenance metadata without exposing any AI trigger entry point.
- 已解决: Owner submission detail no longer blocks the main historical Renderer on provenance loading.

### M3 Phase 6 Resolved

- 已解决: `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` implements the `AiProvider` interface for OpenAI-compatible chat-completions backends.
- 已解决: Provider selection is configuration-driven through `labelhub.ai.active-provider`; default behavior remains mock, and real-provider mode fails fast when required env is missing.
- 已解决: `AiReviewService` now depends only on the `AiProvider` interface, so switching providers requires no business-service code changes.
- 已解决: Wire-level provider tests use JDK `HttpServer` without adding MockWebServer/WireMock dependencies.
- 已解决: M3 evidence docs now distinguish completed mock/provider-abstraction verification from pending real API smoke.

### M2 Phase 7b Resolved

- 已解决: Owner task detail now has an embedded dataset section for JSON/JSONL upload, dataset list display, and explicit current-dataset selection.
- 已解决: Multipart upload uses native fetch with the existing auth token helper and browser-managed multipart boundaries.
- 已解决: Browser smoke replaced the remaining SQL/JDBC dataset preparation step with real Owner UI upload and current pointer selection.
- 已解决: P7b live smoke fixed two backend contract edges: generated-interface validation annotations on `DatasetsController`, and lowercase multipart `DatasetImportFormat` conversion.
- 已解决: Published tasks still accept dataset uploads but disable current-dataset switching in the UI.

### M2 Phase 7a Resolved

- 已解决: Backend dataset import now uses multipart `POST /datasets` with JSON and JSONL support.
- 已解决: JSON/JSONL parsing rejects empty datasets and non-object items, and JSONL errors include the failing line number.
- 已解决: Imported dataset items use 1-based ordinal values and canonical SHA-256 item hashes; duplicate item payloads are preserved.
- 已解决: Owner task current-dataset selection is a dedicated `PATCH /tasks/{taskId}/current-dataset` mutation with published-task lock and dataset/task ownership validation.
- 已解决: OpenAPI is now `0.5.0`; frontend upload UI and task-detail dataset selection were completed in P7b.

### M2 Phase 6c Resolved

- 已解决: Labeler "我的数据" lists claimed and submitted sessions.
- 已解决: Submission detail uses `GET /submissions/{submissionId}/render-schema` and renders the historical schema version instead of task current schema.
- 已解决: Shared `schemaVersionLabel` keeps live session and historical submission version copy in sync.
- 已解决: Owner access to Labeler routes is stopped by frontend role guards, and cross-labeler submission access returns backend 404.

### M2 Phase 6b Resolved

- 已解决: Labeler marketplace, claim navigation, live session workspace, autosave status, submit Modal, and validation-blocking flow are implemented.
- 已解决: Cross-labeler session access returns 404 at the API boundary.
- 已解决: Autosave success and failure UI states were smoke-tested.

### M2 Phase 6a Resolved

- 已解决: Shared `SchemaRenderer` supports all seven M2 schema field types with edit and read-only modes.
- 已解决: Answer payloads are keyed by stable field IDs, including nested object children.
- 已解决: P6 file upload field is intentionally a URL/filename placeholder until real upload storage is implemented.

### M2 Phase 5c Resolved

- 已解决: Labeler can submit a claimed session exactly once; duplicate submit returns 409.
- 已解决: Submission inherits `schema_version_id` from the locked session row and stores a server-derived canonical content hash.
- 已解决: Historical render smoke verified a v1 submission still renders v1 after Owner publishes v2.

### M2 Phase 5b Resolved

- 已解决: Labeler can fetch owned session detail with task context, schema version, dataset item payload, and latest draft.
- 已解决: Draft saves are append-only: two saves to the same claimed session create revision 1 and revision 2, and latest draft returns revision 2.
- 已解决: Draft writes lock the parent session, reject non-owned sessions with 404, and reject non-editable sessions with 409.
- 已解决: `DraftMapper` is append-only and reflection-guarded against inherited update/delete surfaces.
- 已解决: `SessionDetail.task` uses a lightweight session-specific DTO instead of fake marketplace availability fields.

### M2 Phase 5a Resolved

- 已解决: Labeler marketplace lists published tasks with schema/dataset pointers and available items.
- 已解决: Claim creates a session, binds `schema_version_id` at claim time, reserves quota, and marks one dataset item claimed.
- 已解决: Quota claim uses optimistic update; dataset item assignment uses row locking.

### M2 Phase 4.5 Resolved

- 已解决: Schema publish now keeps `label_schemas.current_version_id` and `tasks.current_schema_version_id` aligned for P5 claim-time schema binding.
- 已解决: Task publish guard now rejects tasks without a current schema version or current dataset before they can appear in the Labeler marketplace.

### M2 Phase 4c Resolved

- 已解决: Owner Designer can publish a new immutable SchemaVersion from the browser UI, and the current-version pointer updates in the header.
- 已解决: Duplicate schema content now returns HTTP 409 `DUPLICATE_SCHEMA_VERSION_CONTENT` and is shown inside the publish Modal instead of leaking as a 500.
- 已解决: Version history SideSheet shows newest-first versions, current-version tag, content hash prefix, field counts, and expandable read-only schema JSON.
- 已解决: Browser smoke captured v1/v3 JSON evidence for SchemaVersion immutability and current pointer behavior.

### M2 Phase 4b Resolved

- 已解决: Designer supports seven field editors, same-level ordering, nested-object children, validation highlights, and read-only JSON preview.
- 已解决: Keyboard dnd path was added for repeatable smoke after pointer drag proved unreliable for automation.

### M2 Phase 4a Resolved

- 已解决: Schema Designer shell and Owner schema list route are implemented.
- 已解决: Labeler role access to Owner schema route returns frontend 403.

### M2 Phase 3 Resolved

- 已解决: `GET /submissions/{submissionId}/render-schema` is implemented through `SubmissionsController` and `SchemaService.renderForSubmission`.
- 已解决: Local smoke verified a submission bound to schema v1 renders v1 after schema v2 becomes current.
- 已解决: Schema request contract corrected: `fieldStableIds` is no longer accepted from clients because it is derived server-side from `schemaJson`.

### M2 Build Hygiene Resolved

- 已解决: Moved the active LabelHub workspace out of iCloud/File Provider synced Desktop into `/Users/gods./Downloads/LabelHub - Platform`; continue watching for duplicate `ApiApplication 2.class` artifacts, but the known Desktop CloudDocs trigger has been removed.
- 已解决: `spring-boot-maven-plugin` declares `mainClass=com.labelhub.api.ApiApplication` so local runs do not depend on scanning polluted `target/classes` output.

### M1 Phase 5d Resolved

- 已解决: Labeler and Reviewer now have authenticated placeholder routes without fake business behavior.
- 已解决: Login and root redirects route users by explicit role priority rather than backend role-array order.
- 已解决: Sidebar menu items are derived from the current user's roles; no-access users get an explicit empty-state note.
- 已解决: README now includes local startup, implemented scope, roadmap, and differentiator code locations.
- 已解决: Screenshot index now maps current demo images to the contracts they prove.

### M1 Phase 5c Resolved

- 已解决: Owner task detail route `/owner/tasks/:taskId` shows task fields, status badge, transition actions, and transition history.
- 已解决: Shared transition reason modal is used for publish, pause, resume, and end; reason is required and whitespace-only input is rejected.
- 已解决: Browser smoke verified publish -> pause -> resume -> end, with four append-only Timeline entries and stored reasons.
- 已解决: Returning to the task list shows the same task as `已结束`, confirming task-list invalidation after detail-page transitions.
- 已解决: API-level illegal transition check verified an ended task cannot transition back to published and returns 409.
- 已解决: Publish guard failures now return 400 + camelCase `fieldErrors` and render a persistent Modal error such as `无法发布: 配额必须大于 0。`.
- 已解决: Phase 5d remained scoped to Labeler/Reviewer placeholders, screenshot inventory, and M1 frontend wrap-up.

### M1 Phase 5b2 Resolved

- 已解决: Owner task list now uses URL-synced `page`, `size`, and optional `status` parameters as the single source of truth.
- 已解决: Status filtering resets to page 1 and omits `status` entirely for the "全部状态" view.
- 已解决: Create Task modal supports title, description, quota, deadline, and tags with field-level validation and query invalidation after successful creation.
- 已解决: Browser smoke verified created draft tasks appear in the all-status list and disappear from the `status=published` filtered view.
- 已解决: Browser smoke verified the paused empty state and past-deadline field validation.
- 已解决: Backend `TaskStatus` request-parameter conversion now preserves lowercase OpenAPI enum values such as `published`.
- 已解决: Phase 5c remained scoped to Owner task detail, state-transition actions, and transition timeline.

### M1 Phase 5b1 Resolved

- 已解决: Login flow implemented: `owner_demo / demo1234` reaches `/owner/tasks` and renders authenticated Header state.
- 已解决: Wrong-password login stays on `/login` and renders "用户名或密码错误" under the password field instead of firing the global 401 redirect.
- 已解决: Logout clears QueryClient/session state and returns to `/login`.
- 已解决: `RequireAuth` actively rejects missing or expired sessions before protected pages issue business requests; OpenAPI client 401 handling remains as fallback.
- 已解决: `RequireRole` blocks `labeler_demo` from the Owner route and shows the 403 placeholder.
- 已解决: Phase 5b2 remained scoped to Owner task list, status filtering, pagination, and task creation modal.

### M1 Phase 5a-1 Resolved

- 已解决: Context path B方案 selected and verified: OpenAPI server URL and Spring Boot now use `/api`; old non-`/api` runtime paths return 404.
- 已解决: Internal token path check verified with context path: `/api/internal/**` reaches the application only after `X-Internal-Token` passes.

### M1 Phase 5a Resolved

- 已解决: Frontend shell routes now use `createBrowserRouter` with `AppLayout` as the root route.
- 已解决: Vite `/api` proxy verified through the browser console against the local API.
- 已解决: Owner shell navigation is in place; Login, task list, task detail, Labeler, and Reviewer business pages remain for later Phase 5 steps.

### M1 Phase 4 Resolved

- 已解决: SecurityConfig hardening: business endpoints now require JWT authentication; Owner Task endpoints additionally require `ROLE_OWNER`.
- 已解决: Internal API hardening: `/internal/**` is gated by `X-Internal-Token` matching `LABELHUB_INTERNAL_TOKEN`.
- 已解决: Audit payload integrity: `audit_logs` has `payload_hash`, and Task transitions serialize payload JSON via Jackson instead of manual string concatenation.
- 已解决: Real local MySQL smoke passed: `/actuator/health`, Owner login, task create, publish transition, task list pagination, missing-token 401, wrong-role 403, and internal-token 404 for unimplemented internal routes.
- 已解决: Security chain debugging resolved: the attempted multi-chain setup was simplified to one explicit stateless chain after public-route smoke tests returned 401 through error dispatch.
- 已解决: Controller runtime binding fixed: generated endpoint implementations now use explicit `@PathVariable("taskId")` names.
- 已解决: Task list pagination fixed: MyBatis-Plus pagination interceptor and `mybatis-plus-jsqlparser` are configured so `total` reflects real matching rows.
- 已解决: Task resume guard fixed: `paused -> published` is covered by TaskService combination tests, and `canPublish` no longer duplicates state-transition legality checks.

### M1 Phase 1 Resolved

- 已解决: Audit transaction semantics: Task state-machine transitions use strong consistency. `tasks` update + `task_transitions` insert + `audit_logs` insert are one transaction; observational audit remains best-effort. ADR-016 is deferred to Phase 6.
- 已解决: Publish guard depth: M1 state legality is handled by `TaskStateTransitions`; publish business guards check only `quota_total > 0` and `deadline_at > now`; dataset, schema version, and adjudication rule guards moved to later phases.
- 已解决: Task list scope: `GET /tasks` lists only tasks owned by the authenticated Owner; no admin view in M1.
- 已解决: OpenAPI response shape: Phase 2 adds `GET /tasks`, `GET /tasks/{taskId}`, `PagedTasks`, `ApiError`, shared error responses, and bearer auth.
- 已解决: Login response shape: Phase 2 adds `tokenType`, `expiresAt`, and minimal user profile.
- 已解决: OpenAPI version bump: M1 additions bump the contract from `0.1.1` to `0.2.0`.
- 已解决: Demo user seed IDs: use fixed ids `1001/1002/1003` with `INSERT IGNORE` and role-code subqueries.
- 已解决: `humanpending.md` location: root `humanpending.md` remains authoritative; `coderules.md` wording is deferred to a separate protected-file revision.
- 已解决: Testcontainers dependency timing: add Testcontainers only in Phase 4 with controller/security integration tests.
